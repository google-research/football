      # `python -m build` without any arguments is used to check if the wheel can be built from source (sdist):
      #  the tool copies source code to the random temp directory, and proceeds with building.
      #  Doing so insures that MANIFEST.in contains all the required files to build engine from source.
      #  The downside is that we can't cache vcpkg_installed packages, since they'll be located in the random temp directory.
      #  It increases workflow running time from ~15 minutes to ~40 minutes. On the other hand, cache is valid only for 7 days,
      #  and releases are coming not so often anyway.
      # To build in-place and take advantage of vcpkg_installed cache use `python -m build --wheel` instead.
